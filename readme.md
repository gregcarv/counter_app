# Advanced case: NodeJS & Vue

Please code an application with a backend in NodeJS and a frontend in Vue.  
 - Backend and frontend communicate with eachother via websockets. 
 - The backend part sends a counter to frontend which is updated realtime with VueJS. 
 - To raise the counter in the backend you can come up with your own solution. 
 
The idea behind this assignment is to simulate a counter on the website for example, in which the number of orders from backend is updated realtime and displayed on the site.  
  
You can earn bonus points with some simple unit tests for frontend and backend.
